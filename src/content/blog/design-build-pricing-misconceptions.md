## One Price, Many Myths: Let's Talk Design-Build Pricing

Ever looked at a design-build proposal and wondered why the number feels higher than you expected?

Or questioned what design-build pricing actually includes when compared to traditional remodeling quotes for homes in areas like Tacoma, University Place, or Gig Harbor, where layouts, additions, and past renovations can vary widely?

In this post, you'll learn what design-build pricing really means, why it often looks different upfront, and where common misconceptions lead homeowners astray.

By the end, you'll understand how design-build pricing creates clearer budgets, fewer surprises, and a smoother remodeling experience from start to finish.

If you're thinking about a remodel and want straight answers about pricing or our process, reach out to MKR by calling or filling out the contact form.

A quick conversation about design-build vs. a traditional general contractor approach can save you time, stress, and costly misunderstandings later.

## What Design-Build Pricing Really Means

Design-build pricing means:

- The design and construction phases are handled by the same remodeling firm
- Pricing is developed after key design decisions are made, not guessed with allowances
- The goal is price certainty, fewer change orders, and clear accountability
- Costs may appear higher upfront because they reflect the true project cost from day one

## Misconception 1: Design-Build Pricing Is Automatically More Expensive

### Why Design-Build Appears More Expensive at First Glance

Design-build pricing typically includes:

- Project design costs and design work
- Project management and scheduling
- Labor hours, labor rates, and specialized skill rates
- Subcontractor fees and equipment costs
- Project materials and indirect costs

There are no artificially low bids or placeholder allowances meant to win a contract award.

Pricing reflects real selections, real labor rates, specialized skill rates, and realistic timelines.

For projects that involve multiple trades, this transparency often feels more expensive upfront, even though it is more accurate.

### How Traditional Pricing Can Mask True Costs

Traditional design-bid-build projects often rely on:

- Material allowances instead of real selections
- Incomplete scopes during the design phase
- Assumptions made before construction input
- Separate responsibility between the architect and the general contractor

These gaps frequently lead to additional costs once construction begins.

As issues arise, homeowners see cost overruns tied to design changes, unforeseen project conditions, and adjustments to construction documents.

This is one reason cost growth is more common in traditional methods and design-bid-build projects, and why we strongly believe design-build remodeling is the better option in Tacoma.

### How Design-Build Controls Total Project Cost

With the design-build method, design decisions are made before construction pricing is finalized.

Labor, project materials, subcontractor scopes, and equipment costs are handled by one design-build firm (even if the design and construction phases have separate contracts).

This integrated build process reduces mid-project changes that increase final spend.

Because the design-build team collaborates from the start, total costs are tied directly to the scope of work, improving cost control and delivering better cost savings over the life of the construction project.

## Misconception 2: You're Paying Extra for Design Without Financial Benefit

### What Design Services Actually Include

Clearly, home design planning matters for a successful remodeling project.

However, design services in a design-build approach go far beyond aesthetics.

They include space planning and layout development, mechanical engineering coordination, civil engineering review, and CAD support for accurate drawings.

The design phase also covers material, fixture, and finish selection, as well as code and feasibility review before construction.

These design costs help ensure the project is buildable, code-compliant, and aligned with the project delivery method from the start.

Here at MKR, we provide transparent pricing for both the design and build phases, allowing you to clearly see the value of each phase of your project.

### How Design Impacts Pricing Accuracy

Finalized designs allow for:

- Precise material quantities
- Accurate labor hour projections
- Clear subcontractor scopes
- Fewer redesigns during the construction phase

With complete construction documents, a construction company can price actual building costs instead of relying on assumptions.

This level of detail prevents redesigns and demolition changes during the construction phase.

According to a Penn State study, design-build projects typically have 5.2% less cost growth than design-bid-build by significantly reducing cost overruns tied to missing or unclear design work.

### Design as a Cost-Control Tool, Not a Luxury

In a strong design-build model, problems are solved on paper, not during demo.

Conflicts between systems like framing, plumbing, and electrical are resolved before trades arrive on site.

This proactive design-build process leads to fewer delays, fewer change orders, and tighter budgets.

Over time, that approach delivers the best value by reducing additional costs and keeping total project costs predictable.

## Misconception 3: Design-Build Pricing Is Vague or Hard to Understand

### The Core Cost Components in Design-Build Pricing

Design-build pricing is generally made up of:

- Design and planning services
- Labor hours and labor rates
- Project materials and various project materials
- Subcontractor fees and equipment costs
- Indirect costs such as permits, inspections, and temporary utilities

Together, these create a realistic picture of total costs.

### How Integrated Teams Improve Pricing Transparency

In design-build projects, designers and builders collaborate on the same budget from the beginning.

Selections directly affect pricing in real time, allowing homeowners to see how decisions impact project cost.

One design-build team owns both cost accuracy and execution.

This seamless communication creates a single point of responsibility and reduces confusion during project delivery.

### Fixed Pricing vs Allowance-Based Estimates

A fixed price reflects finalized decisions made during the design phase.

Allowances, common in design-bid-build, shift financial risk to the homeowner and often lead to cost growth.

Design-build pricing reduces surprises after construction starts because the fixed price is tied to real scopes, real materials, and a defined construction contract.

This structure is especially valuable for large projects with complex coordination.

## How Design-Build Pricing Reduces Change Orders

### Why Change Orders Happen in Traditional Models

Change orders are common in traditional models because:

- Designs are completed without construction input
- Construction documents are incomplete
- Scope between trades is unclear
- Project conditions are not fully evaluated before work begins

This pattern is especially common in design-bid-build projects where accountability is split between multiple parties.

### Why Design-Build Projects See Fewer Changes

Design-build projects reduce changes because:

- Trades review plans before construction begins
- Materials are selected and approved early
- Scheduling and sequencing are coordinated in advance

This collaboration reduces conflicts during the build process and limits unexpected changes.

Many design-build projects experience fewer cost overruns as a result.

### When Pricing Changes Can Still Occur

Pricing changes can still happen if homeowners request scope changes, upgrade materials after approval, or encounter unforeseen project conditions that could not be identified earlier.

When this occurs, a design build contract clearly defines how adjustments are handled, helping maintain cost control even when changes are necessary.

## How Design-Build Pricing Supports Better Timelines

### Overlapping Design and Pre-Construction Planning

In design-build project delivery, design and budgeting happen together.

This allows materials to be ordered earlier and permits to be coordinated upfront.

By handling both the design and construction phases, the project team can shorten timelines and reduce delays that often increase indirect costs.

### Why Faster Timelines Matter for Cost Control

Shorter projects reduce labor inefficiencies and limit overtime estimates tied to extended schedules.

Fewer delays mean fewer indirect costs and better use of specialized skill rates.

For homeowners, faster project delivery means less disruption and a more cost effective construction experience.

## When Design-Build Pricing Makes the Most Sense

### Projects That Benefit Most from Design-Build Pricing

Design-build pricing works best for:

- Kitchens with layout changes
- Bathrooms involving plumbing or structural work
- Basements, additions, and whole-home remodels
- Construction projects requiring tight coordination between trades

These types of projects require tight coordination between trades and benefit from a single contract and one firm managing the full construction project, which is critical for multi-level homes and additions common in Tacoma, University Place, and Gig Harbor.

### When Other Pricing Models May Be Acceptable

For small projects that are purely cosmetic, traditional methods may still work.

Projects with fully engineered, construction-ready plans can also be priced effectively outside the design-build model.

In some cases, external requirements for multiple bids may push a new project toward a design-bid-build approach.

## What Homeowners Should Look for in Design-Build Pricing

### Signs of High-Quality Pricing Practices

Strong pricing practices include:

- A clear scope tied directly to drawings and selections
- Defined allowances only where unavoidable
- Transparent explanations of what is included and excluded

These practices support cost control and reduce the risk of additional costs later in the build process.

### Questions That Clarify Design-Build Pricing

Homeowners should ask:

- When is pricing finalized?
- Which decisions affect cost the most?
- How are changes handled once construction begins?
- Who is accountable for budget accuracy?

Clear answers to these questions help ensure the project delivery method aligns with expectations and delivers the best value.
